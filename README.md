This <a href = "https://github.com/kevin-wayne/algs4">public repository</a>
contains the Java <a href = "http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/">source code</a>
for the algorithms and data structures in the textbook
<a href = "http://amzn.to/13VNJi7">Algorithms, 4th Edition</a>
by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. This is the official version maintained
by the authors.

## Design goals

Our original goal was to cover the <em>50 algorithms that every programmer should know</em>.
We use the word <em>programmer</em> to refer to anyone engaged in trying to accomplish
something with the help of a computer, including scientists, engineers, and applications
developers, not to mention college students in science, engineering, and computer science.
The code is optimized for clarity, portability, and efficiency. While some of our 
implementations are as fast as the corresponding counterparts in <tt>java.util</tt>,
our goal is to express the core algorithmic idea in an elegant and efficient manner.
While we embrace some advanced Java features (such as generics and iterators),
we avoid other features that interfere with the exposition (such as inheritance and concurrency).

## Contribute to this project

This <a href = "http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/code/wishlist.txt">wishlist.txt</a>
contains a list of algorithms and data structures that we would
like to add to the repository. Indeed, several of the algorithms and
data structures in this project were contributed by others. If interested, please
follow the same style as the code in the repository and thoroughly test your
code before contacting us.
